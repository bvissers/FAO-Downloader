# FAO Downloader

This QGIS plugin allows users to access data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nation. By taking advantage of the FAO API system users can access 26 different datasets. Users can take select a polygon layer from their QGIS projects and download the necessary data through an easy-to-use graphical user interface. Users can que up downloads of thousands of rasters at once by defining which rasters they require and the time period in which they are interested in. The program will automatically download, crop, and apply correction factors to the rasters. For additional information including how to install, use the plugin, and information on all datasets currently available please see the User Manual. Future updates are in the works to add additional functionality to the plugin.

This plugin was made by Brenden Vissers with assistance from Celray James Chawanda. Some Python code was adapted from the work done by Bich Tran on the "Water Productivity and Water Accounting using WaPOR‚Äù project (https://github.com/wateraccounting/WAPOROCW).

Future Development plans include:
- Adding SWAT+ analysis tool.
- Uploading to QGIS plugin repository.
- Fixing accessibility to nonfunctioning workspaces. 
- Other minor improvements.
